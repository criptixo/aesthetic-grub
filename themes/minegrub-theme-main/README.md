![Minegrub Preview "Screenshot"](resources/preview_minegrub.png)

### How do i install it??
- `cd /boot/grub2/themes/` and do `git clone https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-theme.git` 
- change/add this line in your `/etc/default/grub`:
```
GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub2/themes/minegrub-theme/theme.txt
```
- update your live grub config by running `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
- your good to go

### Cycling through the splash texts
There are 20 alternative splash texts that can be automatically cycled through with a script:

- Make the script executable with `chmod +x ./Cycle/Cycler.sh`
- Ensure you're set as the owner of the theme folder. Take ownership if not, with `sudo chown *USERNAME* ./`
- Set the script to always run on startup with `crontab -e` and add `@reboot /boot/grub2/themes/minegrub-theme/Cycle/Cycler.sh` to the bottom of the list.

### Important Notes:
- When you have more/less than 4 boot options, you might want to adjust the height of the bottom bar (that says "Options" and "Console")
- The formula is in the theme.txt, so you should be able to easily adjust it.

### Notes:
- your grub folder might not be called `/boot/grub2/` but only `/boot/grub/`, in any case, grub should be version 2
- the `GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE` in the defaults/grub file should be set to `menu` so it immediately shows the menu (else you would need to press ESC and you dont want that)
- im no linux expert, thats why i explain it so thoroughly, for other newbies :>
