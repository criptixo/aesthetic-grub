# Grubby Terminal

This is a theme for the [GNU GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) (aka
GRUB2) boot loader.  The theme is a play on words that I couldn't resist.  All
artwork is my own, inspired by every dystopian cliche known.

## Installation

I have included a bash script, `install.sh`.  Because this theme works for
multiple resolution sizes (both width and height above 700px), it is necessary
to run this script so that elements of the theme are positioned correctly.
I strongly recommend looking over the script before running it.

Please note that this script requires GRUB to be installed and configured on
your system.
